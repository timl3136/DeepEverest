# DeepEverest: A System for Efficient DNN Interpretation

Prototype implementation of DeepEverest, which is a system that supports efficient DNN *interpretation by example* queries. The paper will appear in PVLDB Vol. 15 (coming soon!), and the preprint version of the paper is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02234.

# Cloning
`git clone https://github.com/uwdb/DeepEverest.git`
`cd DeepEverest`

# Install required packages
The prototype is tested with Python 3.7. You can enter your virtual environment before this step.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
